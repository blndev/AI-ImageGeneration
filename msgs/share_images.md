** Share Images to Earn Credits **

We invite you to share images to help improve our application. Don't worry about privacy - all shared images are anonymous and processed without human review. For each accepted image, you will receive extra credits.

**Important:** Uploaded images must be at least 768x768 pixels in size!

## How It Works

- **Share Future Inspiration:** Upload images of what you want the model to generate in the future. This helps us train the model to create content you desire.

- **All Content Types Welcome:** You can share any kind of image if it includes humans. We especially value images showing what our model currently struggles to generate well.

- **Uncensored Content:** By sharing explicit content, you confirm you have permission to generate such content without censorship (this serves as your consent). Withthat we will remove the censorship for your generations.

- **Human Images Preferred:** Our model works best with images of people. Images that include human faces will earn you more credits.

- **No AI-Generated Images:** Please only upload real photographs, not AI-created images. This helps maintain our model's quality.

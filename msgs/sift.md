# Image Sharing for credits

We encourage you to share images to help us improve our application. You can do this without worrying about your privacy, as all contributions are anonymous.
For each image accepted, you will receive an **additional credits**. Thank you for helping us enhance our model!

Attention: the uploaded images must be minimum in a resolution fo 768x768!

- **Anonymity:** Your shared images remain anonymous, just like your usage of our platform. You will receive generation credits for your current session only.

- **Any Content Welcome:** We accept all kinds of content. Feel free to share images of what you think the model is missing or where it is currently failing in generation.

- **Remove censorship:** By sharing images with explicit content, you proove that you allowed to generate such content without censored regions or prompts (consent check).

- **Focus on Human Images:** Our model is designed to work with images of people. Please ensure the images you upload include a human face. That will give you more credits for generation.

- **Avoid AI-Generated Images:** To maintain the quality of our model, avoid uploading images created by AI. 

- **Automatic Integration:** All accepted images are automatically integrated into our training process without human review. That means what you put in will later be available as generation result.

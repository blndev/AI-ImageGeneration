## 🎮 Running the Application

The project includes a convenient `run.sh` script that handles:
- ✅ Environment setup
- ✅ Dependency management
- ✅ Version checking
- ✅ Application startup

Simply execute:
```bash
chmod +x run.sh
./run.sh
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

Customize your experience through environment variables in `.env`:

### 🎛️ General Settings
- `LOG_LEVEL`: Set logging detail (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)
- `GRADIO_SHARED`: Enable public Gradio link
- `NO_AI`: Development mode without AI processing

### 🎫 Token System
- `INITIAL_GENERATION_TOKEN`: Starting tokens for new users
- `NEW_TOKEN_WAIT_TIME`: Minutes between token refreshes
- `ALLOW_UPLOAD`: Enable image sharing for token rewards

### 🪄 Prompt Magic
- `OLLAMA_SERVER`: Custom Ollama server location (default: localhost)
- `OLLAMA_MODEL`: Model for prompt enhancement (default: artifish/llama3.2-uncensored)

### 🖼️ Generation Settings
- `GENERATION_MODEL`: Choose your model (default: black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-dev)
- `GENERATION_STEPS`: Number of generation steps
- `GENERATION_GUIDANCE`: Guidance scale for generation
- `GENERATION_ASPECT_*`: Configure output dimensions

### 💾 Memory Optimization
- `GPU_ALLOW_XFORMERS`: Enable memory-efficient attention
- `GPU_ALLOW_ATTENTION_SLICING`: Split calculations for lower memory usage
- `GPU_ALLOW_MEMORY_OFFLOAD`: Use CPU memory for model handling

### 🎯 Output Configuration
- `MODEL_DIRECTORY`: Location for downloaded models
- `OUTPUT_DIRECTORY`: Where to save generated images

### 📝 Model Configuration (modelconfig.json)

The `modelconfig.json` file supports a powerful inheritance system that allows you to define model configurations hierarchically. This helps reduce redundancy and makes it easier to manage multiple model configurations that share common settings.

#### Inheritance Example
```json
{
    "Model": "default",
    "Description": "default configuration flux-schnell",
    "Parent": "flux1:schnell"
}
```

In this example:
1. The "default" configuration inherits from "flux1:schnell"
2. "flux1:schnell" inherits from "flux"
3. "flux" is a base configuration with no parent

This creates an inheritance chain where:
- Base settings are defined in the "flux" configuration
- "flux1:schnell" extends these settings with specific parameters for the FLUX.1-schnell model
- The "default" configuration can override or extend these settings further

Properties are inherited recursively, meaning a child configuration will receive all properties from its parent, grandparent, and so on. Child configurations can:
- Override inherited properties by redefining them
- Add new properties not present in the parent
- Inherit complex nested objects (like Aspect_Ratio, Generation settings, etc.)

This system makes it easy to:
- Maintain consistent base settings across multiple configurations
- Create specialized configurations with minimal duplication
- Quickly switch between different model setups while preserving common settings
